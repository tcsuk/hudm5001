# Running Temperature Conversion from the Command Line

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
In this exercise, you will practice running Python scripts from the command line (CL).  
After completing `functions_calling_other_functions.ipynb` you will have written the function `ftoc`, `ctof`, and `convert`.

1) Place `convert` in a script called `convert.py`, noting where you have saved it.  

Add some lines of code to:
- print a title
- call the function with `temp=23` and `toTemp='c'` and print the result

2) Launch the Anaconda Prompt to run Python from the CL  
On a Windows machine, you would select Start and then begin typing Anaconda Prompt  

3) At the prompt, change directory to the script location (using the cd command)  
4) At the prompt, type:

`python convert.py`

This should print the results

5) Make a new file called `convert_arg.py` that takes *temp* and *toTemp* as arguments, computes the function with the passed *temp* and *toTemp* and prints the result.  

6) Run `convert_arg.py` at the CL (with arguments) and verify the result. 

Make sure you can get the correct result to print. The result of `convert_arg.py` must be the same as that of `convert.py`
